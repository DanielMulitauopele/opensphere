## User Stories:

1. As a user, when I come to the dashboard page, I see a navigation bar that has
   tabs for Candidates, Activate Profile, and About, and
   when I click any of those tabs, I'm taken to the index pages of those tabs.

2. As a user, when I click on Candidates, I'm taken to the index page with a list
   of candidates.

3. As a user, when I click on an individual candidate, I am taken to that
   candidate's show page, where I can see the full list of their information:
   name, age, (office that they are running for, and platform.)

4. As a user, when I click on an individual candidate, I see a button label that
   states "This candidate is running for the position of 'Position' for the district
   of 'Location'. Do you want to vote for this candidate?", and when I press the
   Vote button, my vote is recorded and I am redirected to dashboard page.

5. As a user, when I click on the register page, I am taken to an index page that
   gives activation information to the user, and I see a button that says "Activate
   User". When I click that button, I am taken to a page with a form that lets me
   input information that activates my account.

6. As a user, when I click on candidates, I am not able to vote until I have
   activated my account on the activation page. Once I have signed in to my account,
   I am able to see the vote button.
